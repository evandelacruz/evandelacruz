### Welcome to the evandelacruz repo!

The website, http://evandelacruz.com, is meant to serve as a launching point for anyone interested in my software engineering endeavors. It is a very simple HTML page.

If you're interested in my code, the hobby stuff I've been working on lately is in the [Tarti NFT](https://github.com/TartiNft) project.
