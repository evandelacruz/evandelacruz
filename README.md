### Welcome to my Github and the evandelacruz repo!

This is 2 READMEs in one. One for my Github profile and the other for the *evandelacruz* repo.

When I created this repo *evandelacruz/evandelacruz*, I did not realze it was âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ (because it shares the same name as my profile) and would therefore house my primary Github README :) 
I simply named it evandelacruz because that is the name of the server that hosts the deployed website.

So, this repo actually has the code for a website in it as well. The website, http://evandelacruz.com, is meant to serve as a launching point for anyone interested in my software engineering endeavors. It is a very simple HTML page.

If you're interested in my code, the hobby stuff I've been working on lately is in the [Tarti NFT](https://github.com/TartiNft) project.

<!--
**evandelacruz/evandelacruz** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
